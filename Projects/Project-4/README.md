# Meme Generator App

This is my Fourth React App developed + deployed on Netlify), I waf, first, introduced to a brand new code base, I read through it, understand it and then develop new features: like adding the ability to add, update, delete notes, store theme first in the local storage and then in Firebase.
I had the chance to practice old techs: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ES6, fetch API, Async/Await, and Sass.
And also to learn more about
--React Components,
--Props,
--Conditional rendering,
--Pass object as props,
--Spread object as props
--States
--Event listeners in react
--Forms in react
--Manage Side effects and cleaning them up using useEffect Hook
--Lasy Load State
--Debouncing

And how to install it via Nodejs => then npm => then Vite, and run multiple tools via CLI such as, dev tools, and Build. And finally deploy this app on Netlify.
